Steps to Deploy Your Next.js App with Docker and Docker Hub

1. Create a Docker Hub account
   - Go to https://hub.docker.com/ and sign up.

2. Create a repository on Docker Hub
   - After logging in, click "Create Repository".
   - Name it (e.g., sportscardcollection).

3. Log in to Docker Hub locally (optional for testing)
   docker login
   charlienichols0706
   Lindsay6113
   # Enter your Docker Hub username and password

4. Build and tag your Docker image
   docker build -t charlienichols0706/sportscardcollection:latest .

5. Push your image to Docker Hub
   docker push charlienichols0706/sportscardcollection:latest

6. Set up GitHub Secrets for CI/CD
   - In your GitHub repo, go to Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions.
   - Add these secrets:
     - DOCKERHUB_USERNAME
     - DOCKERHUB_TOKEN (create a token at Docker Hub: Account Settings > Security > New Access Token)

7. Update your GitHub Actions workflow
   - Uncomment the Docker login and push steps in .github/workflows/deploy.yml.

8. Deploy your container
   # On your server or cloud host, run:
   docker pull <your-dockerhub-username>/sportscardcollection:latest
   docker run -d -p 80:3000 <your-dockerhub-username>/sportscardcollection:latest
   # Point your domain to your server and set up SSL if needed.
